# Migration to svelte-konva v1

The following document outlines all breaking changes for svelte-konva v1 and how to migrate from svelte-konva v0.

## `config` prop is now splitted into individual props

In svelte-konva v0 the `config` prop contained an object whith all configurabe properties of a Konva node (similar to [vue-konva](https://github.com/konvajs/vue-konva)). With v1 this has now been changed so that the properties of the konva Node are now exposed directly as individual props (similar to [react-konva](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva)):

```diff
<Rect
-      config={{ x: 100, y: 100, width: 400, height: 200, fill: 'blue' }}
+      x={100} y={100} width={400} height={200} fill="blue"
/>
```

### Migration examples

As this is a big API change that requires manual migration work, the most common migration examples are outlined in the examples below:

**Spreading the old config object:**

```diff
<script>
  let config = {
    x: 100,
    y: 100,
    width: 400,
    height: 200,
    fill: 'blue'
  };
</script>

<Rect
-      {config}
+      {...config}
/>
```

**Bound config prop:**

```diff
<script>
  let config = $state({
    x: 100,
    y: 100,
    width: 400,
    height: 200,
    fill: 'blue',
    draggable: true
  });
</script>

<Rect
-      bind:config
+      {...config}
+      bind:x={config.x}
+      bind:y={config.y}
/>
```

You can also bind other properties such as `skewX`, `scaleY`, `rotation`, etc. to receive updates after transformation of the shape.

### Why this was changed:

There are some important reasons that warrant this change, namely:

- By splitting the config prop into individual props svelte-konva can fully leverage the "fine-grainded reactivity" approach of Svelte 5. Changes to an individual configuration property do not lead to the invalidation of the entire configuration.
- Binding/not binding the `config` prop has always had certain caveats and hard to understand side-effects such as changes to properties of the `config` prop made by svelte-konva "leaking" into user code even when the `config` prop was not bound. With splitted props this can no longer happen and binding individual props is now clearly defined and limited to props that can actually be modified by svelte-konva. No more leaking/unexpected changes coming from svelte-konva code if the respective prop is not bound.
- The change brings svelte-konva API-wise more in line with other popular Svelte component libraries (such as [threlte](https://github.com/threlte/threlte))

## Changes to `config` prop reactivity

As the `config` prop has now been splitted into individual props there are some changes in how reactivity works when not using `staticConfig = true`. Consider the following svelte-konva v0 example:

```svelte
<script>
	import { Stage, Layer, Rect } from 'svelte-konva';

	let myConfig = { x: 100, y: 100, width: 400, height: 200, fill: 'blue', draggable: true };

	$: console.log('x changed:', config.x);
</script>

<Stage config={{ width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight }}>
	<Layer>
		<Rect config={myConfig} />
	</Layer>
</Stage>
```

In the above code the `Rect` component is draggable. Each time it is dragged (on `dragend` Konva event) svelte-konva updates the `x` and `y` coordinates of the config prop. Due to how JavaScript works, this internal change also "leaks" into the `myConfig` object despite it not being bound (`bind:config={myConfig}`) due to JavaScript passing the config prop as reference (because it is an object). In the above example, the reactive code block with the `console.log` statement would never be triggered on drag end as Svelte 3/4 had no way of knowing that the value of `x` changed under the hood. It would only trigger if the `config` prop was bound in which case Svelte knows that the config prop could be changed by svelte-konva. Which is why it was recommended in the docs to always bind the config prop if not using `staticConfig = true` in order to avoid this confusing behavior.

This behavior is now alltogether eliminated in svelte-konva v1 due to the splitted config prop. This now allows you to benefit from fine-grained reactivity without any internal svelte-konva changes "leaking" into the parent component. Directly migrated to Svelte 5 the same example would look like this (with runes):

```svelte
<script>
	import { Stage, Layer, Rect } from 'svelte-konva';

	let myX = $state(100);
	let myY = $state(100);

	$effect(() => {
		console.log('x changed:', config.x);
	});
</script>

<Stage width={window.innerWidth} height={window.innerHeight}>
	<Layer>
		<Rect x={myX} y={myY} width={400} height={200} fill="blue" draggable />
	</Layer>
</Stage>
```

When dragging the `Rect` component now, svelte-konva still updates its internal state of the `x` and `y` coordinates on drag end. However, this time `myX` and `myY` variables are never updated by svelte-konva as they are not bound (They stay 100 and no reactive dependencies are triggered). Thus there is no "leaking" change. In case you want to keep your `myX` and `myY` variables automatically in sync with their acutal position after drag and transform of the `Rect` shape you simply have to bind them. This then allows the changes to the `x` and `y` prop by svelte-konva to propagate up into the `myX` and `myY` state as well as triggering any connected reactive code (such as the `$effect` in the above example).

This now also enables fine-grained reactivity where you are able to run reactive code for individual changes to the `x`, `y`, ... props instead of everytime any property in the `config` object changed. In case you still need to be able to react to any change made by svelte-konva after transform or dragging you should use the `ondragend` and `ontransformend` event hooks of the svelte-konva component directly.

### Changes to the `staticConfig` prop

As the svelte-konva updates on drag and transform end are no more "leaking" into the parent component when the properties are not bound the use of the `staticConfig` prop changes slightly. The behavior of `staticConfig = true` in svelte-konva v0 can now be simply achieved by not binding any props in svelte-konva v1. Thus it is generally recommended to not use `staticConfig = true` for normal usage. When using `staticConfig = true` svelte-konva does not listen to the `dragend` and `transformend` event of the node and does not update its internal state. This can lead to slight performance improvements in case the user does not use any bindings.

## Event handlers

In Svelte v5 usage of the `on:event` syntax is deprecated. svelte-konva provides all Konva events now as callback props using the `on<konva event name>` syntax. The deprecated `on:event` syntax will no longer work for svelte-konva events:

```diff
<Rect
     x={100} y={100} width={400} height={200} fill="blue"
-    on:pointerclick={handleClick}
+    onpointerclick={handleClick}
/>
```

### Event payloads

Additionally the event payload data has changed. Instead of being wrapped in a `CustomEvent` under the `detail` property the whole Konva event payload is now directly accessible:

```diff
function handleClick(e) {
-    const konvaEvent = e.detail;
-    window.alert(`Clicked on rectangle: ${konvaEvent.type}`);
+    window.alert(`Clicked on rectangle: ${e.type}`);
}
```

### Cancel event bubbling

Canceling event bubbling with calling `preventDefault()` on the event payload is no longer supported. Set the `cancelBubble` property of the event to true instead:

```diff
function handleClick(e) {
     window.alert(`Clicked on rectangle: ${e.type}`);
-    e.preventDefault();
+    e.cancelBubble = true;
}
```

## Accessing the underlying Konva handle

The way to access the corresponding Konva handle in a svelte-konva component has changed. You can no longer bind the `handle` prop to access it. Instead `handle` has been renamed to `node` and is now exposed directly on the component instance. To access it use `bind:this` and then access the `node` property on the component object:

```diff
<script>
  import { onMount, tick } from 'svelte';
  import { Stage, Layer, Rect } from 'svelte-konva';

  let rectangle;

  onMount(async () => {
-    const json = rectangle.toJSON();
+    const json = rectangle.node.toJSON();
     window.alert(`Rectangle as JSON: ${json}`);
  });
</script>

<Stage width={1000} height={1000}>
  <Layer>
    <Rect
       x={100} y={100} width={400} height={200} fill="blue"
-      bind:handle={rectangle}
+      bind:this={rectangle}
    />
  </Layer>
</Stage>
```

### Why this was changed:

- Properties on the component instance are read-only enforced by the compiler -> Users cannot accidentally overwrite it anymore causing undefined behavior inside svelte-konva
- Renaming `handle` to `node` makes brings the naming in line with Konva terminology -> Existing Konva developers know immediately what they are getting when accessing `node`

## Underlying Konva node is defined immediately after component instantiation

The internal logic of svelte-konva has been overhauled in order to provide a better developer experience. The Konva `node` which you can now access directly on the component instance (using `bind:this`) is now immediately defined. There is no longer a need to wait a Svelte `tick()` before accessing it as in previous versions.

In previous versions it was required to wait a `tick()` in order for the Konva stage wrapper div HTML element to become available (rendered to the DOM). As only then a new Konva Stage Object and any child svelte-konva layer and shape components were instantiated. Like this:

```svelte
<script>
	import { onMount, tick } from 'svelte';
	import { Stage, Layer, Rect } from 'svelte-konva';

	let stage;

	onMount(async () => {
		// Wait for dom update so the stage handle becomes defined
		await tick();

		const json = stage.handle().toJSON(); // Caution: handle() can return null if the stage has not been created yet (eg. canvas HTML component has not yet been rendered)
		window.alert(`Stage as JSON: ${json}`);
	});
</script>

<Stage config={...} bind:handle={stage}>
	<Layer>
		<Rect config={...} />
	</Layer>
</Stage>
```

Now all underlying Konva objects are immediately instantiated once a svelte-konva component is instantiated by Svelte. The way this works is that svelte-konva first creates a fake div element on the `document` object and attaches the Konva stage there. Once the real wrapper div has been rendered to the dom the Konva stage is transferred to the real wrapper div. The old example above would be migrated to:

```svelte
<script>
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';
	import { Stage, Layer, Rect } from 'svelte-konva';

	let stage;

	onMount(async () => {
		const json = stage.node.toJSON();
		window.alert(`Stage as JSON: ${json}`);
	});
</script>

<Stage width={1000} height={1000} bind:this={stage}>
	<Layer>
		<Rect x={100} y={100} width={400} height={200} fill="blue" />
	</Layer>
</Stage>
```

### Why this was changed

- internal svelte-konva logic has been simplified, the context manager does no longer need to use reactive writables
- Better developer experience as accessing the Konva node on svelte-konva now works consistently accross all svelte-konva components without any special exceptions (For example, in some cases awaiting `tick()` was not necessary if svelte-konva components were wrapped in user defined renderless components)

## Passing props to the wrapping stage div

When using the svelte-konva `Stage` component, svelte-konva automatically creates a HTML div element which contains the Konva stage. Previously you could pass props to this div by using the rest props on the `Stage` component. With v1 this is changed such that you can now pass props directly using the new `divWrapperProps` prop on the `Stage` component. It accepts an object containing all props that are directly passed to the wrapper div:

```diff
<Stage
     width={1000} height={1000} bind:this={stage}
-    id="myWrapperDiv"
-    class="wrapperDivClass otherClass"
+    divWrapperProps={{
+       id: "myWrapperDiv",
+       class: "wrapperDivClass otherClass"
+     }}
>
</Stage>
```

This has been changed due to Konva configuration props colliding with certain div props (for example `id`) which made it impossible to distinguish whether the prop was aimed at the Konva node or the div wrapper.

## Svelte runes-only mode

svelte-konva is now fully compatible with Svelte's runes-only compile mode which means it will work out of the box for runes-only projects. It will also continue to work for all projects without runes-only mode enabled.
